                <p>
                    At Coffee, coffee is more than a drink—it’s an <i>experience</i>.

            <h2>The Goal</h2>
                <p>
                    At Coffee, we're more than just a place to grab a cup of coffee; 
                    we're a community where warmth and joy come together. Our 
                    mission is simple: to share the transformative love of the 
                    gospel with everyone who walks through our doors. We believe 
                    that every interaction is an opportunity to spread hope and joy, 
                    and we strive to make each moment count. Whether through a warm 
                    smile, a listening ear, or a heartfelt conversation, we aim to 
                    share the message of love and redemption that has changed our 
                    lives. Our coffee shop is more than just a place to grab a 
                    drink; it's a place where people can experience the love of 
                    God in a real and tangible way. Come join us, and let's share 
                    a cup of coffee and a story of hope together!
